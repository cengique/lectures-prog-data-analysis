      <description>This site contains a collection of lectures, assignments, and instructor materials for teaching software engineering or development, at an intermediate level. It is assumed that students already know basic software engineering terms and skills.
Materials are used for the ITEC 3870 Software Development II course taught at Georgia Gwinnett College . They were developed by Cengiz Gunay and Anca Doloc-Mihu , supported by an Affordable Learning Georgia grant in 2019-2020.</description>
